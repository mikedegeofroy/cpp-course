Developing and maintaining an open source project is a big effort. MapSCII isn’t supported by any big company, and all the contributors are working on it in their free time. We need your help to make it sustainable.

There are many ways you can help:

- Answer questions in [GitHub issues](https://github.com/rastapasta/mapscii/issues).
- Review [pull requests](https://github.com/rastapasta/mapscii/pulls).
- Fix bugs and add new features.
- Write articles and talk about MapSCII on conferences and meetups (we’re always happy to review your texts and slides).
