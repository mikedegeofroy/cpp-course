# Taking a C++ course in University

> **Disclosure:**
> I'm doing this to learn and make content for my portfolio. The code in here will probably be messy, and I will slowly but surely rewrite most of it. So make sure to read the readme's in the sub-folders to keep up with any changes. Also, I'm keeping the labworks as I submitted them to my teachers / mentors, and then worked on changes to make them better, so make sure to see the commit history and read the readme's. 

# Prelogue

Before taking this course in my first year at ITMO University, I was already quite familiar with code. At this point I've done multiple small projects, mostly in the frontend feild (javascript and it's frameworks). I was familiar with C++, but never actually dove deep into it, since it's hard to implement in real world situations, unless you're already quite experienced.

It's safe to say, that at this point I was quite familiar with the unix environement, understood quite well the workings of my machine, and was good at using the cli (Terminal).

# Labwork 1

I was quite confident, this was more of a "getting up to speed" labwork, and we had 2 weeks for it, so I went all in. Here's the result.
